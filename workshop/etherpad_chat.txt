Daren Card - Instructor:09:21 ASK ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE HERE
Michael RW:09:29 is there a command to go up two levels towards root, instead of just one at a time?
:09:29 cd ../..
Michael RW:09:29 ty
Daren Card - Instructor:09:33 More context: you can specify 'full' or 'relative' paths using one command, instead of doing it directory by directory
SRB:09:35 .hidden?
Bao:09:35 youfoundit.txt
Michael RW:09:35 .hidden
Pat Faughnan:09:35 . .. youfoundit.txt
:09:35 youfoundit.txt
barry:09:36 youfoundit.txt
SRB:09:36 ahh youfoundit
Michael RW:09:49 SraRunTable.txt
barry:09:50 SraRunTable.txt
barry:09:50 No Folders
barry:09:51 /bin/cat* /bin/chacl* /bin/chgrp* /bin/chmod* /bin/chown* /bin/chvt* /bin/cp* /bin/cpio*
barry:09:52 no /bin/a*
barry:09:53 no /bin/*o.*
MSV:10:03 for last item problem 3 I defined a set of charaters: ls /bin/*[a,c]
Daren Card - Instructor:10:18 Viplano: yes, you can also do it that way. This is fancier stuff called regular expressions, which allow you to match text patterns. We could do a whole workshop on that, but won't really be talking much about it. Worth learning the basics of regular expressions, for sure!
:10:28 what does touch mean?
SRB:10:28 how do you put your command history in a new window?
Daren Card - Instructor:10:28 It creates an empty file with the name you specify
:10:28 but is the command called touch?
Daren Card - Instructor:10:29 @SRB: we've used a little trick to do this. I can show you during a break if you ask me.
Daren Card - Instructor:10:29 yes it is called touch
:10:40 sorry, I meant to ask why touch is called touch?
Daren Card - Instructor:10:42 touch is a commonly used verb that basically means to refresh a file. If the file doesn't exist it will create it. If it does, it will update the metadata to show it was last modified at the time you touched it.
:10:43 thamks
Dr. Palumbo:10:47 How do you copy something? How do you rename something?
Daren Card - Instructor:10:48 @Palumbo: cp <source> <destination> copies
Daren Card - Instructor:10:48 @Palumbo: mv <source> <destination> renames (it moves the old file to a new file)
:11:14 what does piping mean?
Daren Card - Instructor:11:18 to pipe means to take the output of the first command and automatically use it as the input for the second command, rather then writing it out to the screen
Dr. Palumbo:11:32 What is cut? What is -F?
Daren Card - Instructor:11:34 @Palumbo: cut excises a given field from a text file. Usually fields are separated by tab (default) or other characters
Daren Card - Instructor:11:35 @Palumbo: -f (lowercase) is the argument flag where you can specify which field you want to cut (1 - # fields)
MSV:11:35 If you write a txt file with a Windows editor (e.g. Notepad) are the tabs that you put in that file also seen as "tabs" by Nano or other editors?
Daren Card - Instructor:11:35 @Vioplano: Yes, they should be.
MSV:11:35 Thks
SRB:13:29 does it matter if you put spaces before/after = sign?
Daren Card - Instructor:13:33 I don't think so, but give it a try and see
Dr. Palumbo:13:35 What do curly brackets do? What is _string2?
SRB:13:35 nope, does not like it
Daren Card - Instructor:13:41 @Palumbo: The curly brackets are just part of the syntax of specifying a variable. They aren't required in most cases, but sometimes are necessary, and they can help with readability
SRB:13:47 is it remembering the filename variable from before?
Daren Card - Instructor:13:51 @SRB: if you haven't unset it or replaced it, then yes
SRB:14:02 why are {} necessary/unnecessary
Daren Card - Instructor:14:15 @SRB: it is somewhat a personal preference and in some cases you must use the {} to get the effect you want.
Daren Card - Instructor:14:15 @SRB: no {} is a small shortcut that usually works, but {} is the best way to specify variables
SRB:14:28 so " space " is concatenate?
:14:28 clear as mud
MSV:09:00 Testing, testing... is this thing on? :-)
Lingling:09:01 yes
unnamed:09:12 is ssh specific to the amazon server or is that a general way to log in?
Lingling:09:39 ssh is for login to a server in general
Lingling:09:40 you can find detailed description here http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ssh1.html
Wayne:09:55 You can find a diagram of paired and unpaired and stranded vs un stranded at http://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library_type.html . The current main Ilummina chemistry for paired corresponds to the "ISR" type.
SRB:10:16 whats the fastqc.zip contain?
SRB:10:16 just the same?
Wayne:10:19 I think same plus logs and images in the report.
SRB:10:25 k
SRB:13:35 whats CMD mean?
Lingling:13:49 command ? what's the context?
SRB:14:26 CMD: bwa mem reference/GC
Lingling:15:49 i think just means "bwa ..." is the command being run
SRB:16:12 R R!
